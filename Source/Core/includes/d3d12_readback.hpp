// D3D12 readbacks for the dev MCP ("luma_read_resource", "luma_read_cbuffer"). A readback is a GPU copy
// recorded into the game's command list at the target command, into a READBACK buffer that is read once that list ran. The target is a draw
// or dispatch, or a copy, resolve or clear: the command is re-issued natively right before the copy, and the original call is skipped.
// D3D12 has no state queries and Core doesn't track resource states (ReShade's "barrier" event drops subresources), so only what is
// certain is copied: render targets and unordered access views right after the draw, a depth or stencil plane after a draw whose
// pipeline writes it, what a copy left in COPY_DEST, a resolve in RESOLVE_DEST, a render target clear in RENDER_TARGET and a depth stencil
// clear in DEPTH_WRITE, constant buffers in UPLOAD heaps (always GENERIC_READ). The barriers are legacy ones: textures a game manages
// with enhanced barrier layouts are outside their interop rules.
// Completion never waits for a queue inside present (the game can have it wait on a fence it signals after present): a copy gets its own
// fence, signaled on its queue at a present, and its buffer is read at a later present once that fence passed ("Advance()").
