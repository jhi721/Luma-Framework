// Memory for the root constant buffer views Luma appends to the game's root signatures ("LumaSettings", "LumaData"). A root CBV is a GPU
// address recorded into a command list, so what it points at must keep its bytes until the GPU ran every list that recorded it. The memory
// is persistently mapped UPLOAD buffers ("Pool"), handed out as 256 byte aligned allocations of 64 KiB pages. The ring never waits for the
// GPU: it grows when no page is free, and takes pages back by the fences of the queues that ran them. Native D3D12 only (no ReShade
// calls): the caller passes the native device (growing creates a buffer under the pool's lock, a ReShade proxy would fire events), the
// native queues and its device's present count, and holds the pool in a "std::shared_ptr" (a command list's data can outlive its
// device's, ReShade's command list proxies don't reference the device).
//
// A command list allocates from pages of its own ("Pages", used by one recording thread at a time, no lock). When the list is reset or
// destroyed ("Retire()") its pages are free at once if it never executed, else once every queue that executed it ("OnExecute()") passed
// the value "Present()" signals there, "EXECUTE_MARGIN" presents after the execution. Pages every list may point at (the device's
// copies of the settings) are a "Pages::shared" that retires its page against all queues when it fills.
//
// Call order: "RegisterQueue()" for each DIRECT and COMPUTE queue (the already existing ones too, when the pool is made late),
// "Allocate()" while recording, "OnExecute()" at "execute_command_list", "Retire()" at "reset_command_list" and "destroy_command_list",
// "UnregisterQueue()" at "destroy_command_queue", and "Present()" at each present with the count it makes. A list executed at count N is
// only certain to be done once the fences passed N + 2, see "EXECUTE_MARGIN".
