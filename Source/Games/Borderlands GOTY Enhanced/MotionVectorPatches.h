// Motion vectors for a game that renders none, by patching whole DXBC containers (Core's
// "motion_vector_patch.h"; this file holds the game's slots and registers).
// Vertex shaders run twice: the second run reads the previous frame's per-draw constants (UE3's b0 $Globals: LocalToWorld, material
// parameters; b1 VSOffsetConstants: ViewProjectionMatrix, CameraPosition; b3 VSBoneConstants: the bone palette) from other slots, and
// only its SV_Position is kept, as an extra output. The first run's SV_Position is also copied to an extra output, as outputs can't be
// read back. Pixel shaders write the UV space delta from the current to the previous position to an extra target.
// Tested offline on every cached shader (docs/BorderlandsGOTY-DLAA-Research.md, "Patch configuration").
