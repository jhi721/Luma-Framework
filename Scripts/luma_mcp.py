"""Stdio MCP bridge for the Luma DEVELOPMENT addon backend (Source/Core/includes/mcp_server.inl).

A Development build serves "\\\\.\\pipe\\luma-mcp-<pid>" from its load, and runs the requests at present.
This process advertises the tools up front, connects lazily (and reconnects after game restarts),
and post-processes readbacks: decodes DXGI formats, computes channel statistics and writes a PNG preview.

Needs Python 3 with numpy. Register it in .mcp.json, with the repository as the working directory:
  "luma": { "type": "stdio", "command": "python", "args": ["Scripts/luma_mcp.py"] }
