// table gives a different continuation; the constants are probe positions, not curve coefficients.

// A secant, not an analytic derivative: the table is discrete, so this cannot be claimed to match the
// local slope of the neighbouring texels.
//
// The validity test is LOCAL by construction. A table that is globally non-monotone but rising across
// the window still yields a usable fit and is accepted; only a window that is flat, falling or
// non-finite is rejected. That matters for R16_UNORM, where quantization can flatten a short run: the
// answer there is to report the rejection, never to substitute a slope of 1 or one borrowed from
// another game's curve. Local validity is not a statement about the whole table.

// bloom would lower the fitted slope and make the working response FALL while the native one rises.
// That is the defect this family was rebuilt to remove - do not reintroduce B-dependent anchors.

// costs nothing extra. The probes still may not be cached across frames - the table's contents can be
