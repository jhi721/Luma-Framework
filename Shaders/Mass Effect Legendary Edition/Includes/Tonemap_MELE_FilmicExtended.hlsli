// table gives a different continuation; the constants are probe positions, not curve coefficients.
//
// Both evaluators hand their result straight to MELE_TryBuildGradeProxy, which rejects a non-finite or
// negative working value before any use. Only what that check cannot see is validated here: the inputs,
// because a bad channel that stays below the pivot selects the native sample and would otherwise pass.

// scale covering scene-linear to about 16.2. This is the raw read, with no pre-curve of any kind.

// The slope denominator is the difference of the NODES. The input scale is already inside the sampled
// values, so dividing by a coordinate delta would count it twice.
//
// A secant, not an analytic derivative: the table is discrete, so this cannot be claimed to match the
// local slope of the neighbouring texels.
//
// The validity test is LOCAL by construction. A table that is globally non-monotone but rising across
// the window still yields a usable fit and is accepted; only a window that is flat, falling or
// non-finite is rejected. That matters for R16_UNORM, where quantization can flatten a short run: the
// answer there is to report the rejection, never to substitute a slope of 1 or one borrowed from
// another game's curve. Local validity is not a statement about the whole table.

// so each stage is continued separately and the bloom keeps its place:
//
//   W_tone = E_L(E_F(C) + B)
//
// It is NOT ell(F(C + B)); those two diverge as soon as the bloom is non-zero.
//
// THE FIT NODES COME FROM F ALONE and do not depend on C or B. Anchors that move with the signal they
// extend invert this curve's direction: the table flattens as its coordinate rises, so a brighter
// bloom would lower the fitted slope and make the working response FALL while the native one rises.
// Do not introduce B-dependent anchors.
//
// One fit serves all three channels, so a tinted bloom costs nothing extra. The probes still may not be
// cached across frames - the table's contents can be rewritten in place, so a cache keyed on the SRV
// pointer would be wrong.
//
// Per channel, the continuation runs when the SECOND stage has passed its pivot - which a bright bloom
// alone can cause even where the scene never left the native region. Otherwise the caller's native
// sample is reused, because both stages then stayed native and it IS the native result.
//
// There is no third case. C > pivot with a non-negative bloom puts z above pivot_z algebraically, and
// where float32 rounding defeats that (slope * (C - p) underflowing to zero within about a thousand
// ULP of the pivot) a fresh read at z returns exactly the native sample anyway - measured over the
// full ULP neighbourhood and a 200k random float32 sample on the shipped table.
