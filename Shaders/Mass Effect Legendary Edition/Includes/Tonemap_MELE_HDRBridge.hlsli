// Pure math. Prerequisites, which this file deliberately does NOT include:
//   Includes/Common.hlsl      MELE_IsFiniteNonNegative
//   ../Includes/Color.hlsl    gamma_to_linear, GetLuminance, GCT_MIRROR, CS_BT709
//   ../Includes/Math.hlsl     max3, FLT_MAX  (arrive through Color.hlsl)
//   ../Includes/Reinhard.hlsl ReinhardRange
// Reinhard.hlsl has no include guard, so including it from here would redefine its contents in the
// bodies that already include it. Include it in the body, before this file.

// Max-channel proxy. One scalar for all three channels, so the limiter cannot move an RGB ratio; the
// per-channel character stays owned by the working curve and by the native reference.
//
// Adapted domain. For every MELE family the tail from grade input to linear gradedHDR is
// MELE_NativeGammaCurve followed by gamma_to_linear(., GCT_MIRROR), which with an identity colour grade
// composes to (scale*c)^r for r = GammaColorScaleAndInverse.w * DefaultGamma, read from the frame's own
// cbuffer and never hardcoded to 2.2. Scaling the grade INPUT by s scales the decoded linear OUTPUT by s^r,
// so compressing in the adapted domain makes the restore exact - W = A(X), P = q*W, Q = A^-1(P) scales the
// input by q^(1/r), the output by exactly q, and a plain divide undoes it. A raw input multiply with a
// linear divide would leave a q^(r-1) residue whenever r != 1. A negative working value is refused before
// either conversion, so GCT_MIRROR never sees one here.
//
// ReinhardRange with In_Peak <= 0 compresses from infinity and is the shifted rational shoulder this
// needs: identity at and below k, C1 across the seam, asymptotic to 1. It is NOT ReinhardPiecewise,
// which matches value but not derivative at its seam.
//
// q BELONGS TO THE ADAPTED DOMAIN. It is not transferable between gamma, LUT codes, scene units and
// nits, and MELE_TryRestoreGradeRange must be handed the same q this produced.
//
// Every check runs BEFORE the pow, the division and the LUT read it protects. An invalid working
// value cannot be recognised afterwards from the finiteness of the output: every grade this feeds
// passes it through a LUT read or a saturate (MELE_NativeGammaCurve opens with one), which launders
// a bad input into a plausible number.
//
// On failure both out parameters keep the neutral values written at entry and the caller must use
// neither: false means the HDR reconstruction declined and the caller retains the exact
// native SDR reference for the whole RGB triple. On success q is finite and in (0, 1].

// The NATIVE colour contract for families 01-04: RGB ratios from the exact native grade result,
// luminance from the new working value. Y is the same linear BT.709 luminance on both sides, so on a
// finite positive reference the reference's channel ratios survive exactly - the per-channel shift
// and the whitening the native chain produced are kept, not undone. A coloured reference stays
// coloured, equal channels stay equal, and a channel the grade zeroed is not refilled.
//
// Of the working value only Y is used; its own hue and chroma are deliberately discarded.
//
// The guarantee ends here, before the shared output tail. The vignette, DICE, the user controls, grain
// and dither all run after it.
//
// Guard contract, deliberately not one blanket fallback:
//   the WHOLE reference triple is validated, not only its luminance: a reference with a negative
//     channel can still have a positive luminance.
//   exactly black reference or exactly zero target -> black. The grade produced that black.
//   near-black but positive reference -> divided normally. The LUT permutations carry clampFloor, so
//     a vanilla black arrives here at 1e-4 in luminance, two decades above the guard. Collapsing that
//     to black would erase a real part of the native output; count the guard's trips, do not widen it.
//   a non-finite gain or product -> the reference itself for the WHOLE triple. Switching channels
//     independently would change hue, which is the failure being avoided.
// A positive target luminance is never clamped to 1, and no path takes colour from the raw scene.
//
// Declining returns the reference unscaled, which is the exact native SDR result the caller already
// holds - there is no second HDR model to fall back to and no fallback for a caller to choose. A
// bool + out-parameter form would move that decision to the call site, and it was written and
// measured: fxc costs 3 to 4 extra instructions on every permutation that uses this helper, because
// it stops folding the fallback into the select it already emits. That is the eighteen of families
// 01-04, +4 on sixteen of them and +3 on the two analytic ones; 0x225A8330 takes its colour from the
// hue donor instead, never calls this, and did not move. Measured, not assumed. Do not re-attempt it
// without re-measuring.
