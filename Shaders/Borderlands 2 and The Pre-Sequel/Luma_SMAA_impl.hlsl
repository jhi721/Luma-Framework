// SMAA for Borderlands 2 / The Pre-Sequel. Reference: https://github.com/iryoku/smaa
// ULTRA preset + color edge detection, run POST-tonemap on the gamma LDR (main.cpp RunPostTonemapSMAA) so it cannot
// perturb the DoF composited inside the tonemap; the native FXAA is cancelled while SMAA is on (main.cpp's FXAA
// override). Edge detection reads the ENCODED post-tonemap signal, the domain its thresholds are
// tuned in; neighborhood blending reads the LINEAR-light decode of that same signal (Luma_BL2TPS_SMAALinearize) and
// this file re-encodes the blended result, so what goes back downstream is still the game's gamma 2.2 LDR. The PS
// appends no HDR tail (Display Composition does paper-white + scRGB). Predication = plane-deviation edge-ness
// built from the scene-color .a depth (Luma_BL2TPS_DepthExtract), null texture + scale 1.0 as the fallback.

// (1/W, 1/H, W, H) at output resolution — filled by the mod (see main.cpp RunPostTonemapSMAA).
