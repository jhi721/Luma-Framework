// HDR follows the MELE 01-04 split (Shaders/Mass Effect Legendary Edition/Tonemap_ME_Analytic_Body.hlsl). The
// exact native ImageAdjustments + ColorGradingLUT result is the COMPLETE colour reference, including the game's
// per-channel hue, saturation, tint and its own highlight whitening. A separate unbounded continuation of the
// measured K=0 response (W*c in linear light) passes through a reversible bounded copy of the real LUT to obtain
// HDR luminance, and ONLY that luminance is projected onto the native graded RGB ratios. DICE performs the only
// final display rolloff. SDR computes none of it and stays bit-for-bit vanilla.
//
// This is NOT inverse tonemapping, NOT hue restoration from the raw scene, and NOT MELE family 05's hard-clip
// treatment: no path anywhere takes chroma from the working value.
// The per-channel ImageAdjustments curve below MUST keep the original's swizzles (r0.zzxy / r3.z,w,xy) — a
