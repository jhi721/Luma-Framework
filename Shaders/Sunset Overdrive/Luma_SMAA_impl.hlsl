// SMAA for Sunset Overdrive (reference: https://github.com/iryoku/smaa), in place of the game's SMAA blend PS_SmaaApplyBlend
// 0xD8DB5270. It runs the ULTRA preset with color edge detection on the tonemap's output, which the blend reads at t5 (a copy of it
// with SMAA 1x), and writes the blend's target.
// The input is the tonemap's sRGB encoded output with display-mapped HDR values, so >1 is possible. Edge detection works on it as is,
// and neighborhood blending filters the same texture after a gamma 2.2 decode (the display composition's) and re-encodes.
// The engine's render resolution is independent of the window, so the metrics come from main.cpp (LumaData.CustomData1/2 = size).
// Predication uses plane-deviation edge-ness in [0,1] of the scene depth (Luma_SO_SMAAPredication); main.cpp passes a null texture
// and scale 1 (plain ULTRA) without it.

// "SMAA_T2X" 1 is SMAA T2x in place of the game's (main.cpp's "SO SMAA T2x" passes). The scene jitters by a quarter pixel diagonally
// in two phases. The blending weights take the phase's area texture subsamples (LumaData.CustomData4, 0 when the frame didn't jitter),
// the neighborhood blend stays gamma 2.2 decoded with the velocity length in alpha, and the resolve blends it with the previous frame
// reprojected by the motion vectors. The output hook below runs at the resolve.
